There are 2 functions:

The first one returns the minimum number of coins used for getting the change.
The table was created by using a List (float('inf')) that is multiply by list of coins. 
Then we have 2 loops, for demo in demo covers all the coins in the input array and the other for is getting the min value against the last 2 values.

The second returns which coins did it use to get the input change. 
It's modify for getting the coins it used.
